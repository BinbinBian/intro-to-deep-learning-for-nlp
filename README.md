We take a crack at explaining the following topics: 

1. What is deep learning? 
2. Motivation: Some use cases where it has produced state-of-art results 
3. Basic building blocks of Neural networks (Neuron, activation function, back propagation algorithm, gradient descent algorithm) 
4. Supervised learning (multi-layer perceptron, recurrent neural network) 
5. Introduction to word2vec 
6. Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks 
7. Text classification using RNN 
8. Impact of GPUs (Some practical thoughts on hardware and software)
